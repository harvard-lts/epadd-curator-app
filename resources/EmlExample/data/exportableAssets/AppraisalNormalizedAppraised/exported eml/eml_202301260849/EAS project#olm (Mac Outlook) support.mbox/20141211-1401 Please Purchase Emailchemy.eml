Hi Julie and Skip,




It appears that LTS and the Library have decided to fast-track
development on .olm support in EAS. Since your units have asked about
Outlook Mac support, I have a few questions for you (to help get this
effort started).




#1 What version of Outlook Mac are the files you want to process?

#2 Can you provide a *clean* sample of .olm data for LTS testing?

#3 Do you know a way to export to .olm selectively by mail folder?




The task in question #3 (how to selectively archive to .olm format)
might be harder than it looks. I know you can archive an entire mail
account to .olm, but there is no evidence you can limit archiving to a
single folder. You can filter archiving by "category" so I suppose an
Outlook Mac user could define a fake category and assign it to a subset
of messages, then archive on the category.




We need *clean* data only, so ability to cherry-pick out any sensitive
data is important.




Thanks for your help. --julie
