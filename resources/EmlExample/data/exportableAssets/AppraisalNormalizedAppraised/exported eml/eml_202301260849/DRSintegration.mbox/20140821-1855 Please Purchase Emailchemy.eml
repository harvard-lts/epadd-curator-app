Hi, Robin and Andrea:

I have two questions for you:

1) I am trying to figure out if searching by email address in DRS is
supported. I think that once in DRS, full-text of email will not be
searchable (Andrea could you confirm that this is true for both secure
and standard storage). If it is true, is it that way because it is
governed by the content model or because the file extension "eml"
dictates it? In addition, in the DRS descriptors, all of the
correspondents (To, from, CC, and BCC) are represented only by Wordshack
(WS) URIs for people and only after they have been manually related to
email addresses (or vice versa) in WS.

To search by email address in DRS, would one need to have a related
person in WS and then search on the person in DRS? What field would they
search in? Does this mean that there is no searching by email address if
no relationship has been created to a person in WS?

2) Is the requirement for metadata about the attachment in the
descriptor to put the file name of the attachment in the descriptor, or
to put the subject line from the email in the descriptor? We have
differing recollections on this one.

At this point, I am just trying to figure out what the real behavior is
before trying to assess the implications.

Thank you.

Yours,

Wendy
