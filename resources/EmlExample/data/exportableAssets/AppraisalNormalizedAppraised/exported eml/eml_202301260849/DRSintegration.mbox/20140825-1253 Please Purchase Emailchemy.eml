Hi Chris,

We  are currently planning on having a meeting with the EAS stakeholders
on the morning of Monday September 15th =C2=96 where we normally have a dem=
o
of EAS in QA which should have been well tested in QA previously.
Unfortunately during testing of EAS we uncovered various issues, some of
which need to be included in DRS in order for the EAS push to DRS to
work.  These issues have either been fixed and tested in DRS2 DEV or
soon will be.

We are hoping that you can do a QA release of DRS before September 15th
so that EAS QA can be properly tested and released to the EAS users on
September 15th.

Here are the current known issues which EAS needs to be released to DRS2
QA and PROD before EAS can be released to the users in either of those
environments:

1. Ingested Review Date/Note overwritten in DRS2 Web Admin
https://jira.huit.harvard.edu/browse/LIBDRS-1203
Without this change review dates are not stored correctly in DRS and
will be overwritten if a review date is added via DRS Web Admin.

2. OTS needs to accept a wildcard for mime subtype
https://jira.huit.harvard.edu/browse/LIBDRS-1266
Without this change items from eudora and outlook mailboxes will be
rejected by DRS when pushed from EAS to DRS

3. OTS: allow objects to have multiple rights blocks with a secure
storage restriction
https://jira.huit.harvard.edu/browse/LIBDRS-1191
Without this change items with multiple rights blocks with a secure
storage restriction will be rejected by DRS when pushed from EAS to DRS
This version of OTS is due to to "released" by end of day tomorrow
(Tuesday)

4. Update FITS code in Github
https://jira.huit.harvard.edu/browse/LIBDRS-1189
Note that EAS will use FITS 0.8.2 when generating the descriptors for
pushing to DRS.  This version of FITS contains a fix to a threading
issue which affects EAS.  It also includes some other changes used in
DRS migration. This version of FITS is due to be officially released by
end of day tomorrow (Tuesday).

Will it be possible to do a release of DRS2 to QA earlier than you had
scheduled?

Thanks,
Grainne
