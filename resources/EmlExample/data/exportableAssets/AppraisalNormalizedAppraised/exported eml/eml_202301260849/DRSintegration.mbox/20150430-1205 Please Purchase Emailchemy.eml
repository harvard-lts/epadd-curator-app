Hi Julie,

Here is some information on the QA EAS "Push packet events to DRS2"
process.

The only packet level events in EAS are those created when an item is
deleted from EAS.  The generated event has a "DELETE_COMPONENT" event
type and is associated with the EAS Packet.  They may be viewed in EAS
at https://easi-qa.lib.harvard.edu:9035/easi/packets.action?tab=3Devents .

These events are only pushed to DRS2 if the corresponding EAS Packet has
already been pushed to DRS2, which occurs when an item from the packet
is pushed to DRS2.  By delaying the timing of the push of EAS Packet
delete events in this way it permits the users to delete all items from
a packet as they work on it and ultimately decide that they do not want
to preserve the packet.  In this way the DRS2 will not be cluttered with
delete events which the user does not want to preserve.

The "Push packet events to DRS" runs as a cron job each evening at
20:30pm.
The EAS DRS prearchiver runs every 5 minutes between 8am and 8pm Monday
through Saturday.

In order to test the "Push packet events to DRS" functionality you will
need to find a packet which exists in both EAS and DRS2 and which has
associated items in EAS.  I'm not sure of the most efficient way of
determining this. You could have two tests, one which depends upon the
other

1.=09Push items from EAS to the DRS2 =C2=96 taking note of the packet id
in EAS and the resulting packet object id in DRS2.
2.=09Wait 5 minutes to be sure the EAS prearchiver has run and then
delete items from the same packet in EAS.
3.=09Request that I enable the "Push packet events to DRS2" jobs in
QA
4.=09Verify results in DRS2 once the DRS2 index update has run (you
won't see the events until that happens)

I hope that this helps?

Thanks,
Grainne
